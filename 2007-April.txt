Dear all, I have Destar running on an Asterisk server. From another
machine I enter http://IP_Asterisk:8080, and I get the login asking me
user and password. I check /etc/asterisk/destar_cfg.py but I don't know
where I have to set user and password for full Asterisk administration,
because I can't login for that reason (I no have user and password).

Thanks a lot,

Alejandro

If you installed destar and have a destar_cfg.py maybe is a copy of the
examples/destar_cfg.py one. If so, the default password for the admin user
is ad26. (with the final point)

Anyway, if there is a destar_cfg.py and you can't log in automatically, 
you should search for a CfgOptUser object in the file in order to get 
valid user login information.

If you have more questions, write us again or contact us in #destar at 
irc.freenode.net.

Please, let us know about the situation.

Bye bye.
