I'm trying to connect Asterisk to a VoicePulse account with DeStar.  I
don't think the IAX or SIP trunk forms provide enough flexibility for me
to do this, however.  I see two potential ways to accomplish this:

1) create the config file manually and somehow tell DeStar to include it
(is this possible?)

2) write my own configurator for VoicePulse.  I looked at the format of
the existing config generators and it looks quite simple, so I wouldn't
mind doing this.  However, whenever I tried to generate a FWD or Iaxtel
trunk (just for an example, I don't actually have an account), it
crashed.  Are these supposedly working?  Should I install 0.2.2 from source?

I'm just running the package in Debian stable (etch).  I can post the
error messages if this problem isn't known yet.

Otherwise the software looks great and I'm really looking forward to
using it more.  This is coming from someone who's spent a week+ trying
to get freepbx running on Debian without taking over his entire system.  ;)

Nice work.

Hello tobias.

Pleas try to use last svn trunk:

  /svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/destar/trunk/


Or if you want, you could also use the last debian package available in 
experimental:

  http://packages.debian.org/experimental/destar


Also, if the normal sip trunk configlet does not meet your provider 
setup, you can always make a new configlet and help us extens DeStar:

Thanks for using DeStar.

Aren't some extra libraries (not from Etch) required?

Why should the custom configlet reimplement CreateAsteriskConfig ? 
Can't you inherit from the existing sip trunk?

I just did this and got the server running.  I connected and created an
admin account, and logged back in.  Now I'm trying to create a phone,
but there is no link on the Phones page to do this!  ????

That looks great; I was looking for a page like that but didn't find it
before.

Is the answer to this question so obvious that it doesn't even deserve a
response?  Sorry, I'm still stumped.

Phones depend on VirtualPBX and Trunk objects, so you may want to create 
one of each at least.


You can also start your configuration file by using the provided example 
in:   trunk/examples/destar_cfg.py

I was missing a VirtualPBX object.  Thanks.  Could you put a note on the
Phones page stating what the user needs to do before s/he can create a
phone?

Ok, I was able to configure a basic working setup with VoicePulse and
DeStar using the SVN checkout, without any custom trunks, for both
incoming and outgoing calls.  This is great.

Now I need to figure out how to do redundancy.  I will get back to the
list when I have it figured out or have hit a wall.

Thanks for your help.

Using the latest SVN I get a crash when I click "View/Save

appendValue in configlets.py needs to write a unicode string but it
doesn't seem to know about unicode.  Attached is a patch that fixes the
problem for me, and includes better debugging info if an unsupported
type is discovered again.

Best,

Subject: [Destar-user] alias extension that forwards to a call queue
Message-ID: <474A1D27.6060702@ppckernel.org>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I created an alias extension 'voicepulse_in' that handles incoming calls
from the 3 trunks of my voip provider, so I can change how incoming
calls are routed in a single place.

However, when I call in now, I get this error in the asterisk CLI:

Nov 26 01:02:27 WARNING[2847]: channel.c:2597 ast_request: No channel
type registered for 'QUEUE'
Nov 26 01:02:27 NOTICE[2847]: app_dial.c:1056 dial_exec_full: Unable to
create channel of type 'QUEUE' (cause 66 - Channel not implemented)

The offending lines in extensions.conf seem to be:

exten=voicepulse_in,1,Set(CDR(pbx)=caktus,CDR(userfield)=voicepulse_in,CALLERID(num)=${CALLERIDNUM}-110)
exten=voicepulse_in,n,Macro(dial-std-exten,QUEUE/voicepulse_q,out-voicepulse_q,110,caktus)

Where voicepulse_q is:

exten=voicepulse_q,1,Queue(voicepulse_q|Tthrn|||20)
exten=voicepulse_q,n,Goto(caktus,tobias,1)

If I manually set each trunk to dial 'voicepulse_q' directly it seems to
work fine.

Ideas?

Is there a way to configure voicemail to come on automatically if (a) a
user isn't connected and (b) after specified number of seconds, if the
user doesn't pick up?  Right now it seems like I have to manually enable
and disable voicemail by setting up the voicemail settings app and
dialing *94 and *95.

Sorry if the answer is obvious; I've looked through the manual and
searched through web interface but didn't find anything.

Thanks.

Each user can do it through the web interface using its account. 

But I think it must be changed, if global voicemail is enabled, the
default vm config for a new phone would be enabled too.

I also think this should be the default behavior.

However, right now it can be done manually, by doing something like:

# cat *voicemail.conf*  | grep -e "^[0-9]."|awk -F "=" '{print "asterisk -rx \"database put pbx1/VMU "$1" True\""}' > activate_voicemail.sh
# cat *voicemail.conf*  | grep -e "^[0-9]."|awk -F "=" '{print "asterisk -rx \"database put pbx1/VMBS "$1" True\""}' >> activate_voicemail.sh
# sh !$


Where "pbx1" is the  name of the virtual PBX.

Are you sure that it works with StringTypes? I don't understand well the
difference, but I get only exceptions with it.

This is supported since python version 2.2. I am using Python 2.4.4 on
Debian.  See the bottom of:

http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.4/lib/module-types.html

StringTypes is "A sequence containing StringType and UnicodeType used to
facilitate easier checking for any string object. Using this is more
portable than using a sequence of the two string types constructed
elsewhere since it only contains UnicodeType if it has been built in the
running version of Python. For example: isinstance(s, types.StringTypes). "

Sorry, maybe I misunderstood.  Do you mean that, after applying that
patch, you always get an exception when you load that page?  If so, what
is the exception?

They are like this:

  File "/usr/share/destar/python/page_admin_viewconf.ptl", line 83, in _q_index
    res = backend.createAsteriskConfig()
  File "/usr/share/destar/python/backend.py", line 433, in createAsteriskConfig
    c.createAsteriskConfig()
  File "/usr/share/destar/python/cfg_opt_transfer.py", line 51, in createAsteriskConfig
    c.appendValue(self, "blindxfer")
  File "/usr/share/destar/python/configlets.py", line 165, in appendValue
    raise Exception(errormsg)
Exception: unsupported type <type 'str'> for object '#1'

Thanks,

Santiago

Please try the attached patch to see if it solves the problem.  This
should be applied to the original SVN, not to a version with my patch
already applied.

Thanks.
